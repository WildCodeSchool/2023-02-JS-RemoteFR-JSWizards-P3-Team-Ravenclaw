            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>
              Origins is born from the fusion of 2 EMG subsidiary companies : On
              Rewind & Netco Sport both specialising in digital services
              tailored for broadcasters and sports federations. They are backed
              up by EMG's unique know-how and world-renowned expertise to master
              the entire value chain from image creation to distribution.‚Äç

              Netco Sports, created in 2008 and integrated into the group "EMG"
              in 2015, has a strong experience in developing premium tailored
              mobile/TV/console applications in the sports industry. On Rewind,
              born in 2015 and part of EMG since 2017, is an innovative company,
              specialising in OTT and new UX products.

              As a result of merging these two companies together in 2020, under
              the name "Origins Digital", we can now address all digital
              projects with a new product-oriented strategy, gathering our wide
